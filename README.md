# Graduation Project 2021 MIU (Misr International University)
We are (Amr Ehab, Mostafa Ashraf, Omar Shereef, Seif ElDein) working on a android mobile app as the mobile industry is in rapid evolution making smartphones available with affordable rates for all segments of society. Smartphones' purposes are not limited to making phone calls or sending messaging, users can also take photos, store personal data, do online banking and trace their daily activities. The more applications appear, the more security becomes a concern to mobile users. This concern arises from the fear of being subjected to a security breach that jeopardizes confidential personal data such as emails, passwords, location, credentials etc. Malware applications which are developed for the sake of compromising usersâ€™ personal data are also increasing rapidly day after day. In our work, we aim to design an intelligent detection framework for android malware applications. The framework uses different analysis-based approaches along with different machine learning algorithms to distinguish between malware and benign applications.
